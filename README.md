### Quick summary: ###

* Project is already configured for development and production use (server-sider rendering).
* Code used for server side-rendering is not minified so its possible to debug ssr with Chrome-Node Dev-Tools.
* Production bundle gets minified and split out with vendor dependencies.

Run the project:
1. `yarn` - install dependencies
2. `yarn dev` - start in development mode
3. `yarn build` - build project to /dist directory,
5. `yarn start` - run server bundle,
4. `yarn debug-ssr` - run (builded) project with chrome-dev-tools debugging option

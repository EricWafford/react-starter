1. Clone the repo.
2. Remove existing (`rm -rf .git`) and initialize new git repo (`git init`).
3. Change *name* in package.json file.

### Quick summary: ###

* Project is already configured for development and production use (server-sider rendering).
* Code used for server side-rendering is not minified so its possible to debug ssr with Chrome-Node Dev-Tools.
* Production bundle gets minified and split out with vendor dependencies.

#### Run the project:
* `yarn` - install dependencies
* `yarn dev` - start in development mode
* `yarn build` - build project to /dist directory,
* `yarn start` - run server bundle,

#### Other handy commands
* `yarn debug-ssr` - debug (built) project with chrome-dev-tools
* `yarn lint` - check `src` directory for eslint errors

### Technology stack: ###
* Yarn for managing dependencies
* React and Redux
* React-Router v4
* WebpackDevServer | HotModuleReplacements
* Express and EJS templates for server-side rendering 
* styled-jsx with styled-jsx-plugin-sass
* focus-ring polyfill
* babel
    * babel-polyfill
    * supports latest EcmaScript features and stage-2 preset.
* eslint - airbnb extension

### CAVEATS:
use webpack-contrib/html-webpack-plugin until [original](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin) will get
migrated to webpack4. More [info here.](https://medium.com/webpack/webpack-4-released-today-6cdb994702d4).
